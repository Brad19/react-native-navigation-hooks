## From `6.0.2` to `>=6.1.0`

### Hooks for navigation event handlers
Interfaces were updated to receive a handler as the first parameter (same as in old version) but the second one is an options object.

This object includes the following base fields:
- `componentId`: To trigger the event only if on the given **componentId**.
- `global` (default: false): Prevent the global event handler warning to being shown.
- `buttonId` (only for the `useNavigationButtonPress` hook): To filter only events for a specific buttonId

#### Before
```tsx
  useNavigationButtonPress(
    (e) => {
      console.log(`Pressed ${e.buttonId} on componentId: ${e.componentId}`)
    },
    'componentId', 
    'buttonId,
  )
```

#### After
```tsx
  useNavigationButtonPress(
    (e) => {
      console.log(`Pressed ${e.buttonId} on componentId: ${e.componentId}`)
    },
    { componentId: 'componentId', buttonId: 'buttonId' }
  )
```
:::tip Use Navigation Context
You can avoid the **componentId** parameter if you're using the [withNavigationProvider](hocs#withnavigationproviders) or [NavigationProvider](contexts#navigationprovider)
:::


### Global event handler warnings introduced

On previous version you were able to define global event handlers without provifing a specific **componentId** when using hooks event handler hoooks. 

Eventough in this new version we didn't break compatibility, we have decided to display a warning suggesting that probably you don't want to handle global events in a particular screen.
