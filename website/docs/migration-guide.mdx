## From `6.0.2` to `>=6.1.0`

### Global event handler warnings introduced

Even though in this new version we didn't break compatibility, we have decided to display a warning suggesting that probably you don't want to handle global events in a particular screen. Anyway as you'll see below you can use the `global` option at your own risk.

### Hooks for navigation event handlers

Interfaces were updated to receive a handler as the first parameter (same as in the previous version) but the second one is now an options object.

This object includes the following base fields:

- `componentId`: To trigger the event only if on the given **componentId**.
- `global` (default: false): Prevent the global event handler warning to being shown.

Some of them also allows you to specify particular fields to filter certain events like the `buttonId` used by the `useNavigationButtonPress` hook.

#### Before

```tsx
  useNavigationButtonPress(
    (e) => {
      console.log(`Pressed ${e.buttonId} on componentId: ${e.componentId}`)
    },
    'componentId',
    'buttonId,
  )
```

#### After

```tsx
useNavigationButtonPress(
  (e) => {
    console.log(`Pressed ${e.buttonId} on componentId: ${e.componentId}`)
  },
  { componentId: 'componentId', buttonId: 'buttonId' }
)
```

:::tip Use Navigation Context
You can avoid the **componentId** parameter if you're using the [withNavigationProvider](hocs#withnavigationproviders) or [NavigationProvider](contexts#navigationprovider)
