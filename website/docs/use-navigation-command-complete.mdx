## `useNavigationCommandComplete`

Invoked when a command finishes executing in native. If the command contains animations, for example pushed screen animation,) the listener is invoked after the animation ends. [more info](https://wix.github.io/react-native-navigation/api/events/#registercommandcompletedlistener)

:::caution GLOBAL EVENT HANDLER
Eventhough you can filter events by `componentName` this hook does not filter them by `componentId` which means that it will be triggered in every mounted screen.
:::

### Examples

<samp id="use-navigation-command-complete" />

```tsx
import { useNavigationCommandComplete } from 'react-native-navigation-hooks'

const ExampleScreen = () => {
  // Listening all the navigation command events
  useNavigationCommandComplete(({ commandId, commandName, completionTime, params }) => {
    console.log(`Command ${name} (${commandId}) invocation finished`)
  })

  // Filtering navigation command events by commandName
  useNavigationCommandComplete(({ commandId, commandName, completionTime, params }) => {
    console.log(`Command ${name} (${commandId}) invocation finished`)
  }, 'commandName')

  return <Text>Example Screen</Text>
}
```
