## `useNavigationCommand`

Called whenever a Navigation command (i.e push, pop, showModal etc) is invoked. [more info](https://wix.github.io/react-native-navigation/api/events/#registercommandlistener)

:::caution GLOBAL EVENT HANDLER
Eventhough you can filter events by `componentName` this hook does not filter them by `componentId` which means that it will be triggered in every mounted screen.
:::

### Examples

<samp id="use-navigation-command" />

```tsx
import { useNavigationCommand } from 'react-native-navigation-hooks'

const ExampleScreen = () => {
  // Listening all the navigation command events
  useNavigationCommand((commandName, { commandId, layout }) => {
    console.log(`Command ${commandName} (${commandId}) invoked`)
  })

  // Filtering navigation command events by commandName
  useNavigationCommand((commandName, { commandId, layout }) => {
    console.log(`Command ${commandName} (${commandId}) invoked`)
  }, 'commandName')

  return <Text>Example Screen</Text>
}
```
