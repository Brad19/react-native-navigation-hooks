## `useNavigationScreenPop`

Invoked when screen is popped. [more info](https://wix.github.io/react-native-navigation/api/events/#registerscreenpoppedlistener)

### Examples

#### Using Navigation Context

<samp id="use-navigation-screen-pop-using-navigation-context" />

```tsx
import { useNavigationScreenPop } from 'react-native-navigation-hooks'

const ExampleScreen = () => {
  // Listen events only for this screen if screen was wrapped with NavigationProvider
  useNavigationScreenPop((e) => {
    console.log(`Screen was popped on componentId: ${e.componentId}`)
  })

  return <Text>Example Screen</Text>
}
```

:::caution Provide a Navigation Context
If your screen wasn't wrapped with the [NavigationProvider](contexts#navigationprovider) nor using the [withNavigationProvider](hocs#withnavigationproviders) HOC it will `console.warn` you about it!
:::

#### Manually

<samp id="use-navigation-screen-pop-without-navigation-context" />

```tsx
import { useNavigationScreenPop } from 'react-native-navigation-hooks'

const ExampleScreen = ({ componentId }) => {
  // Listen events only for this screen by providing componentId as paramenter
  useNavigationScreenPop(
    (e) => {
      console.log(`Screen was popped on componentId: ${e.componentId}`)
    },
    { componentId }
  )

  return <Text>Example Screen</Text>
}
```

### Reference

#### Methods

`useNavigationScreenPop(handler: (event: ScreenPoppedEvent) => any, options: Options): void`

`useNavigationScreenPop(handler: (event: ScreenPoppedEvent) => any, componentId?: string): void`

#### Types

`Options: { componentId?: string, global?: boolean }`

#### Options

`componentId?: string`

Filters the event from being triggered on every mounted screen but rather the one you've hooked with the event.

`global?: boolean`

Disables the `console.warn` for the cases you don't provide a `componentId` through options nor context. In case you want to handle events globally for doing stuff like tracking/logging we encourage you to use the `Navigation.events()` from **React Native Navigation**
