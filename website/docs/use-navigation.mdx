## `useNavigation`

Gives you all the `Navigation` commands exposed by **React Native Navigation** enhanced with a set of [handy overloaded methods](helpers#createNavigationCommands) which reduces significantly the boilerplate code making it it much more clean and readable.

On the other hand you will have to provide the `componentId` only once when you declare the hook. Or even better you can forget about it when it is used in conjunction with the [NavigationContext](contexts#NavigationContext) as the hook will do it for you by obtaining the `componentId` from the context. Also this is very useful in certain situations where you wanna access the commands from deeply nested childs.

### Example

:::tip Use Navigation Context
The example below assumes that the screen was registered and wrapped it with the [NavigationProvider](contexts#navigationprovider) to pass the **componentId** down to the three below so the **useNavigation** hook can read it.

You can either wrap the screen with the [NavigationProvider](contexts#navigationprovider) or take advantage of the [withNavigationProvider](hocs#withnavigationproviders) helper.

<samp id="use-navigation-example" />

```tsx
import React from 'react'
import { Button, View } from 'react-native'
import { useNavigation } from 'react-native-navigation-hooks'

const ExampleScreen = () => {
  const { setStackRoot, pop, push, showOverlay } = useNavigation()

  return (
    <View>
      <Button
        title="Home"
        onPress={() => {
          setStackRoot('HomeScreen')
        }}
      />

      <Button title="Back" onPress={() => pop()} />

      <Button
        title="Next Screen"
        onPress={() => {
          push('NextScreen', { myProp: 'value' })
        }}
      />

      <Button
        title="showOverlay"
        onPress={() => {
          showOverlay('ScreenOveraly')
        }}
      />
    </View>
  )
}
```
